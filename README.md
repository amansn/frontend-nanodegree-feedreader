# Project Overview

In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The goal of this project was to learn how to use Jasmine to perform testing. An initial spec was already included in the code to serve as reference. I was able to write a series of tests to ensure the web-app worked correctly.

## To Run

1. Download the files to a directory on your local machine.
2. Open index.html in a web browser to view the application.
3. To determine if the tests have passed, check the Jasmine area at the bottom of the page.
